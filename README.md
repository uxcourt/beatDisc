# rhythmcircle
A visualization of time offering the ability to mark its passage with eight sounds

The code is 100% html, css, javascript, and json.

Sounds are Base64 encoded and loaded into the sounds.js file.

Controls allow the user to 
* specify any postive integer to draw equidistant slices of the time
* speed up or slow down or stop the rotation
* export or import patterns as json files

# usage
Click on any of the eight concentric circles to add a mark. When the circle is rotating, the mark will make a sound as it passes the12 o'clock position.
Click on any existing mark to remove it.

# current bugs
Let me know if you find any; it seems stable and performant on all platforms I've been able to test with.
